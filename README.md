## 🎯 The Problem

The existing university bus transportation system is disorganized and inefficient, creating a daily hassle for students, teachers, and staff. This disorganization negatively impacts punctuality, comfort, and overall satisfaction with the commute.

The core issues this project aims to address are:

* **Lack of Scheduling & Tracking:** There is no proper schedule or real-time route tracking. Users cannot see which bus is on which road or get an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for their stop.
* **Poor Reliability:** Buses frequently miss designated stops or arrive late, directly causing students to miss classes.
* **Overcrowding:** A lack of available seats often forces students to stand for the entire journey.
* **Seating Conflicts:** Teachers and staff do not have designated seating arrangements, leading to situations where students occupy their seats.
* **Maintenance Issues:** Maintenance records are not tracked systematically, which can lead to unexpected and disruptive breakdowns.

## 💡 The Solution

**(Describe your project here. How does it solve the problems listed above?)**

**Example:**
This project provides a centralized platform with two main components:
1.  **A mobile app** for students, teachers, and staff to view real-time bus locations, check schedules, and receive alerts.
2.  **An admin dashboard** for the transport authority to manage routes, track bus maintenance, and communicate with users.

Our solution introduces reliability, transparency, and comfort to the university commute.
